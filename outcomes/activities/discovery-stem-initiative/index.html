    <p><span class="first-letter">A</span>s part of La Trobe’s Bachelor of Education (Primary), pre-service teachers (PSTs) are required to complete a unit on teaching science, based around the <a class="info" href="#" data-infoBoxId="e5">e<sup>5</sup> pedagogies</a> of teaching and the use of the Primary Connections workbooks. In 2016, in collaboration with ReMSTEP, this unit included the pilot program of the La Trobe Discovery STEM Initiative, aimed at increasing the science communication skills of the PSTs.</p>

    <p>The Discovery STEM Initiative brought groups of 2–4 PSTs to the Bendigo Discovery Science and Technology Centre (DSTC), and partnered them with a primary school class from one of four local primary schools.</p>

    <p>The activities that the PSTs conducted as a part of this project were;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An introductory session at DSTC, to introduce the PSTs to DSTC and explain what was going to be done,</li>
        <li>Interactions and planning activities for each class with an in-service teacher from a local primary school,</li>
        <li>Planning and team teaching of an “Engage” lesson to a class of primary students in a classroom, in conjunction with the mentor teacher,</li>
        <li>Assisting and participating in an “Explore” workshop for the same primary school class at DSTC,</li>
        <li>Creation of a digital “Explain” lesson, to be taught after by the in-service teacher after the workshop, and</li>
        <li>Completion of a reflective journal for their formal assessment of the program.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The workshop, taught by DSTC staff, was created to complement the Primary Connections unit being taught at the local school.</p>

    <p>The PSTs, primary school students and DSTC staff enjoyed the program, and thought it was a valuable partnership. PSTs recognised the value in using DSTC as a resource for teaching their students in the future. PSTs said they gained a knowledge of the Primary Connections units and the e<sup>5</sup> model of teaching that they had not previously known about, and the local teachers saw new approaches to teaching science that they had not previously implemented in their own practice.</p>

            <p>After seeing the scientist model the lesson on making slime … it would be quite simple to be able do that in a lesson on practicum in the future.</p>

        </blockquote>
    </div>
    
    <p>The PSTs also said that they found ‘science was easier to teach and more interesting than they have previously experienced,’ and that they would be more comfortable with teaching science in their own practice. Teachers also commented on the interest of their students with the topic material was much higher than what would normally have been achieved in the classroom.</p>

        <h2>The e<sup>5</sup> model</h2>
        <p>The purpose of the <a href="http://www.education.vic.gov.au/school/teachers/support/Pages/e5.aspx" rel="external">e<sup>5</sup> Instructional Model</a> is not to describe all the work that teachers do in the school but to demonstrate how teachers use what they know in the classroom.</p>
        <p>Defining what high quality teaching and learning looks like in the classroom allows us to describe <b>how teachers use what they know in their interactions with students</b>.</p>
        <p>The e<sup>5</sup> Instructional Model emphasises what the teacher is doing, not what students are doing in the classroom or what students are capable of doing when they leave the classroom.</p>
