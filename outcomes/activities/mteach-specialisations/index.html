These pathways are designed for those who have a relevant study or employment experience and/or a strong interest in teaching these subjects. Entry is competitive, and was first offered in semester 2, 2014.</p>

            <p>You have to talk about [STEM], you have to read about it to make sense of it. For these students, we assume or expect they know what STEM is. So once we have those definitions then we can start talking to them about planning for the teaching of STEM. And that planning, which is the centre for any good lesson, is absolutely critical to know where the learning opportunities are for your students. So you have to plan in great detail… and it is hard work and time-consuming work for the beginner teacher.</p>

    <p>Prior to the ReMSTEP project, the 200-credit-point MTeach program required study of 25 points of mathematics education subjects and 12.5 points of science education, but had no specialist pathways. To create these specialisations, existing units were changed and a new elective was created, resulting in a minimum of 50 points in mathematics or science.</p>

    <p>To gain entry into these specialisations, applicants are chosen on the basis of previous study, employment, or other experience in the field. Their results in Primary Mathematics Education, a compulsory first-year subject, are also examined.</p>

    <p>In 2015, a new elective was introduced: <i><a href="/outcomes/activities/educ90794/">Science and Mathematics in the Classroom</a></i>, focusing on the integration of STEM ideas into the primary classroom environment.</p>

    <p>Cooperation between the Science and Education departments at the University of Melbourne was essential to the development of these specialisations, and partnerships were also developed with a range of research centres, including the Victorian Space Science Education Centre and the Gene Technology Access Centre.</p>

    <p>In 2016, one-third of graduates from the Master of Teaching (Primary) graduated with a Mathematics or Science specialisation. From 2017, in line with <a href="http://www.aitsl.edu.au/initial-teacher-education/ite-reform/primary-specialisation" rel="external">new AITSL standards</a>, all graduates in this program will specialise in one of eight fields. The ReMSTEP project laid the groundwork for the creation of these specialisations.</p>
