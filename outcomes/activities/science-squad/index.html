    <p>The Monash Science Squad was planned, designed, developed, and implemented by a trial with six select primary schools supported by undergraduate science students and educators from the faculties. Students used the site to access a diverse listed range of science activities, such as ScienceWorks, which they could attend with family and or friends.</p>
    <p>The objective was for parents to support their children in their learning and interest about science by participating in activities. Students who attended any of the listed activities, other science activities (e.g., gardening at home with a parent), or an in-school science project were able to record and rate their learning experiences. Students were awarded points for the number of activities they had completed during the trial period, based on the hours of their involvement in each logged activity. Volunteer Monash University undergraduate science students helped with monitoring the site, responding to the children’s posted questions, and assisting with the celebration event.</p>
    
    <p>At the end of the year, children, their parents, and the teachers were invited to a celebration event held at Monash University where the children’s efforts were showcased by a display of posters that they had created, and acknowledged through the awarding of certificates.</p>
    
    <p>A number of participating science students were motivated to consider taking up teaching as a career, with some science students who initially intended to become secondary teachers changing their focus to careers in primary education. The primary teachers had the opportunity to observe children’s learning preferences through monitoring the children's reflections on the website. The teachers surveyed at the Celebration Event all agreed that the Monash Science Squad had a positive impact on children's interests and would have a long-term impact on the children's future aspirations. All parents surveyed at the Celebration Event agreed that the MSS had increased children's enjoyment of science and increased participation outside of school.</p>
