    <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Multidisciplinary Science and Technology in Education (MSTiE) program was developed by Dr Peter Cox for third year undergraduate Bachelor of Education (Primary) students studying in Bendigo to encourage them to create more engaging and interactive units of work for their students. ReMSTEP was involved from 2014 to 2016 to provide additional experience and resources to the project.</p>

    <p>This program involved the pre-service teachers (PSTs) designing and delivering a STEM unit, during their third year school placement. Using scientists and resources from La Trobe University’s School of Molecular Sciences, the PSTs worked in groups of 1 and 2 to create a STEM unit of work for their students within 5–8 one-hour lessons.</p>

    <p>This development process included:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Meetings between PSTs and scientists to discuss how topics could be taught in interactive and interesting ways, using support from ReMSTEP and La Trobe University.</li>
        <li>Providing materials and consumables for activities that would not have been able to be completed without support, such as solar cars kits.</li>
        <li>Planning incursions done by a scientist, in order to increase engagement or to handle dangerous materials, such as liquid nitrogen.</li>

    <p>This project was focused in regional Victoria, and the PSTs who participated valued the support from ReMSTEP, especially in obtaining the materials and support from the scientists and the School of Molecular Sciences. Most of the PSTs found that they would be able to replicate on their own the experiments they created, if they did not require specialist or dangerous equipment or materials. The lesson plans produced contain ideas on how to teach new topics and will serve them well in their teaching career.</p>

    <p>The MSTiE project will continue to run in the future in the third year students studying the of the Bachelor of Education (Primary). The project resources handed in as a part of the student’s assessment in years prior can be made available to other students if permission is given, these can be used for ideas and models to use in the classroom. The equipment, on loan from the School of Molecular Science, will continue to be available.</p>
