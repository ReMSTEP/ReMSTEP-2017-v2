    <p><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Australian Maths and Science Partnership Programs (AMSPP) are a nationwide set of projects aimed at improving the learning and outcomes of teaching math and science. ReMSTEP has partnered with the projects that were being conducted at La Trobe University: Growing Tall Poppies, In2Science, and FARLabs.edu.au.</p>

    <p>In the collaboration with Growing Tall Poppies, ReMSTEP brought together pre-service teachers (PSTs) with the intensive 3-day program conducted at La Trobe University. In these intensives, the PSTs observed and participated in the activities with the year 9 and 10 students. The PSTs were exposed to the inquiring and contemporary nature of content delivery for the students who participated in the Growing Tall Poppies Program.</p>
    
    <div class="row">
        <blockquote>
            <p>Being involved with the Growing Tall Poppies program has really powerfully influenced how I am thinking about teaching</p>

    <p>Working with the Department of Chemistry and Physics at La Trobe, ReMSTEP partnered undergraduate physics and chemistry students with the In2Science project, which trained them to be volunteer peer mentors in Year 8/9 science and maths classes.</p>
    
    <p>FARLabs.edu.au, a free online tool to access real laboratory equipment, was defunded in 2015. ReMSTEP came on board to support the program, allowing it to continue operating as an online e-laboratory for PSTs and teachers of physics and general science to utilise in their teaching practice.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Without FARLabs [your curriculum is] going to be a lot thinner and flatter, but with FARLabs you’ve made your lessons rich, you’ve made them relevant, you’ve made them meaningful.</p>

    <p>The overall experience of all participants has been positive throughout the AMSPP collaborations. The PSTs involved with Growing Tall Poppies on three occasions were positive about the experience. The other university students, involved with mentoring students in the Growing Tall Poppies as well as the In2Science programs, were all positive about the programs that they participated in. School students that participated in the Growing Tall Poppies programs found that they were more likely to participate in senior secondary science subjects particularly physics, after participating in the program.</p>
    
    
    <p>The FARLabs.edu.au program has seen positive growth, with over 53 in-service and pre-service teachers signing up in 2016 alone. While ReMSTEP has been supporting FARLabs, FARLabs has been able to bring online an additional experiment for schools to utilise, bringing the total number of experiments to 10.</p>
